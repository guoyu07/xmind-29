#Hello Shopify Team!

My name is Xander Miller, and if you click on the various social media links in the footer you can find out more about my online foot print. But I would like to give you a more well rounded idea of who I am by talking about three 'P' words: Passions, People and Projects.

##Passions
I'm a passionate guy. I'm interested in lots of things, while some people have the problem of finding something they want to do with their life, I've always had the problem of widdling my focus down to just the few things I have time for in one lifetime.

###I'm Passionate about Web App Develepment
These days I could be even more specific. I'm passionate about open source Ruby on Rails development but that may evolve into something else if an even more exciting technology comes along that builds on the strengths of Rails. I love the way tests and the code base build and support each other like the scaffolding supporting a building under construction while the building also provides support for exisitng scaffolding. I love the clean and flexible syntax of Ruby. I love the git and github workflow. I love that the Rails community is dynamic, always improving, refining refactoring so there is always new things to learn and better ways to do things being discovered.

This is probably what I love most about my Ruby on Rails career thus far. There is always more tearn. It's both humbling and never boring. It's always challenging, interesting and awesome.

###I'm Passionate about DotA 2
A developer who is also a gamer, shocking right? I've always loved computer games, especially strategy games but DotA has been the love of my life. I've been playing DotA consistently for over ten years now. Ever since it was one of the more popular community supported Warcraft 3 mods. DotA was really rough in the beginning it certainly wasn't a game for everyone. But the depth of strategy kept, active community and dynamic strategies kept me comming back. The community changes, new strategies emerge, and the game is constantly patched and refined so there is always something new to learn.

###I'm Passionate about Data 

###I'm Passionate about Open Source, Open Data and Open Science

###I'm Passionate about Learning

###I'm Passionate about Sharing what I Learn

###I'm Passionate about Helping People Help Themselves

##People
Are something else I'm passionate about. A big reason why I love open source software is that it is community base. I've been asked in Shopify interviews before who do I know at Shopify. This question always tongue ties me because I don't know who to mention. I keep running into Shopify people in different circles of my life. Here is a none exhaustive list of Shopify people I know listed losely by how I know them.
