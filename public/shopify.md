#Hello Shopify Team!

My name is Xander Miller, and if you click on the various social media links in the footer you can find out more about my online foot print. But I would like to give you a more well rounded idea of who I am by talking about three 'P' words: Passions, People and Projects.

##Passions
I'm a passionate guy. I'm interested in lots of things, while some people have the problem of finding something they want to do with their life, I've always had the problem of widdling my focus down to just the few things I have time for. 

##People

##Projects
What's I'm passionate about

What's special about me

What's special about you

Things I'm proud to have built

Things I'd be proud to build with you.
